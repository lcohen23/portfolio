              I am passionate about making thorough solutions that can bring
              value to consumers. I graduated from the University of Florida in
              2023 with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Sociology, and
              am currently looking to make a name for myself in the professional
              world.

              I always try to stay ahead of the curve and try new things. Some
              of my hobbies include volleyball, playing guitar, and seeing how
              fast I can beat minesweeper on hard difficulty!
